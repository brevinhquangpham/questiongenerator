For each bullet (denoted by "-") in this markdown file titled "numpy ndarrays", create a question that can be answered by the contents in the original bullet. Return this as a markdown file with the same structure as the original markdown file given. Do not return anything other than the markdown file output. If you feel a question to be vague, add a parenthesis at the end of the question clarifying said question.
